Tetris iOS App üéÆ
Welcome to Tetris iOS, a classic Tetris game built natively for iOS using Swift and UIKit! Drop, rotate, and stack colorful tetrominoes, clear lines, rack up points, level up, and chase that all-time high score. Built with love for retro gaming vibes and coded with a no-limits \GOD MODE/ mindset. üòé
This app was developed as a fun project to recreate the iconic Tetris experience on your iPhone or iPad. Whether you‚Äôre coding on a Mac with Xcode or tinkering on an iPad with Swift Playgrounds, this README will guide you to get the game running!
Features
	‚Ä¢	Classic Tetris Gameplay: 10x20 grid, 7 tetromino shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L), move left/right, rotate, and drop blocks.
	‚Ä¢	Scoring System: Earn 100 points per cleared line (scaled by level). Watch your score climb!
	‚Ä¢	Level Progression: Speed increases every 1000 points, making the game more challenging.
	‚Ä¢	Persistent High Score: Your best score is saved using UserDefaults, so you can flex your Tetris skills across sessions.
	‚Ä¢	Simple UI: Clean UIKit interface with a grid view, score/level/high score labels, and buttons for controls (‚Üê, ‚Üí, ‚Üª, ‚Üì).
	‚Ä¢	Game Over: When the board fills up, get a popup with your final score and an option to restart.
	‚Ä¢	iOS-Native: Built with Swift and UIKit for smooth performance on iPhone/iPad.

Requirements
	‚Ä¢	For Development:
	‚ó¶	Xcode: Version 16.0 or later (recommended for full app development on macOS).
	‚ó¶	Swift Playgrounds: Version 4.0 or later (for coding on iPad, iOS 15+).
	‚ó¶	iOS: 15.0 or later for running the app.
	‚Ä¢	Device: iPhone or iPad (iPad recommended for Swift Playgrounds).
	‚Ä¢	Swift: 5.0 or later.
Installation
Option 1: Using Xcode (Recommended for Full App)
	1	Clone the Repository:‚Ä®git clone https://github.com/itsyourboyfd/tetris-ios.git
	2	cd tetris-ios
	3	
	4	Open in Xcode:
	‚ó¶	Open Tetris.xcodeproj in Xcode.
	‚ó¶	Ensure your iOS device or simulator is selected.
	5	Build and Run:
	‚ó¶	Press Cmd + R to build and run on a simulator or connected device.
	‚ó¶	If deploying to a device, ensure you have an Apple Developer account and provisioning profile.
	6	Optional: Customize the UI in Main.storyboard or add assets for better visuals.
Option 2: Using Swift Playgrounds (iPad)
	1	Download the Code:
	‚ó¶	Copy the contents of TetrisGame.swift and ViewController.swift from the repository.
	2	Create a New Playground:
	‚ó¶	Open Swift Playgrounds on your iPad.
	‚ó¶	Create a new ‚ÄúApp‚Äù playground and name it (e.g., TetrisApp).
	3	Paste the Code:
	‚ó¶	Replace the default code with the contents of ViewController.swift (includes TetrisGame model).
	‚ó¶	Ensure PlaygroundSupport is imported for live view.
	4	Run the App:
	‚ó¶	Tap the ‚ÄúRun My Code‚Äù button to play in the live view.
	‚ó¶	Note: Swift Playgrounds is great for testing but can‚Äôt export to the App Store.
How to Play
	1	Start the Game: Launch the app, and a new tetromino spawns at the top of the 10x20 grid.
	2	Controls:
	‚ó¶	Left (‚Üê): Move tetromino left.
	‚ó¶	Right (‚Üí): Move tetromino right.
	‚ó¶	Rotate (‚Üª): Rotate tetromino clockwise.
	‚ó¶	Drop (‚Üì): Drop tetromino to the bottom instantly.
	3	Objective:
	‚ó¶	Stack tetrominoes to form complete horizontal lines.
	‚ó¶	Clear lines to earn points (100 points per line √ó current level).
	‚ó¶	Level up every 1000 points for faster gameplay.
	‚ó¶	Avoid stacking to the top, or it‚Äôs game over!
	4	High Score: Your best score is saved and displayed on-screen.
Code Structure
	‚Ä¢	TetrisGame.swift:
	‚ó¶	Manages game logic: board (10x20 grid), tetromino shapes, movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring, levels, and high score (via UserDefaults).
	‚ó¶	Key structs/classes: TetrominoType, Tetromino, TetrisGame.
	‚Ä¢	ViewController.swift:
	‚ó¶	Handles UI (UIKit): draws the game board as a UIView grid, renders tetrominoes as colored subviews, and updates score/level/high score labels.
	‚ó¶	Manages game loop with a Timer for auto-dropping blocks.
	‚ó¶	Includes button actions for player controls.
Future Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Touch Controls: Add swipe gestures for smoother movement/rotation.
	‚Ä¢	Visuals: Replace colored blocks with custom images or sprites.
	‚Ä¢	Sound Effects: Add audio for line clears, drops, and game over.
	‚Ä¢	Next Tetromino Preview: Show the upcoming tetromino.
	‚Ä¢	Pause Feature: Add a pause/resume button.
	‚Ä¢	Leaderboards: Integrate Game Center for global high scores.
Known Limitations
	‚Ä¢	No rotation wall-kicks (advanced Tetris feature for smoother rotations).
	‚Ä¢	Basic graphics (colored UIViews instead of polished sprites).
	‚Ä¢	Swift Playgrounds version is simplified (no rotation, smaller board) due to performance constraints.
	‚Ä¢	No animations for block movement (can be added with UIView.animate).
